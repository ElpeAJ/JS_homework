JavaScript Array length
--
Example:
-
The length property returns the length (size) of an array:<br>
const list = ["Banana", 78, "Apple", 56];<br>
let size = list.length;  //prints 4 to the screen

Why Functions?
--
With functions you can reuse code<br>
You can write code that can be used many times.<br>
You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.<br>
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.<br>
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).<br>

Example:
-
//Function to compute the product of 2 numbers<br>
function myFunction(p1, p2) {<br>
  return p1 * p2;<br>
}<br>
console.log(myFunction(2, 4));<br>

Defining functions
--
Regular function: can return anything; <br>
always runs to completion after invocation<br><br>
Generator function: returns a Generator object; <br>
can be paused and resumed with the yield operator <br><br>
Async function: returns a Promise; can be paused <br>
and resumed with the await operator<br><br>
Async generator function: returns an AsyncGenerator object;<br>
both the await and yield operators can be used<br><br>

In JavaScript, there are three main types of control flow statements:
--
if/else statements<br>
switch statements<br>
loops.<br><br>
